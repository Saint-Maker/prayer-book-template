1. Minimum supported screen size in the SaintMaker is 360px width. As per this article https://worship.agency/mobile-screen-sizes-for-2022-based-on-data-from-2021 that will cover approximately 73% of 2021 mobile users (and I assume an even higher percentage of 2022 mobile users).
2. Loading, please wait...
