<details><summary>Coding Standards</summary>
<p>

Krysztof: I pulled the bulk of the coding standards from this guide by [jondjones](https://www.jondjones.com/frontend/react/react-tutorials/react-coding-standards-and-practices-to-level-up-your-code/) (thank you Jon, I owe you a beer) and converted as many as I could to automated coding standards (eslint rules, prettier rules, etc). In addition to that, there is a bundle of other misc/manual coding standards that can be found at the end of this segment.

### Legend:
- (dropped): we aren't following this rule
- (manual): we are following this rule but couldn't find a way to automate it
- (automated): this rule is automatically being followed

## Naming Conventions
- (automated) Component’s names should be written using pascal case
- (automated) Non-components should be written using camel case
- (manual) Unit test files should use the same name as its corresponding file
- (automated) Attribute name should be camel case:
- (dropped) Inline styles should be camel case:
- (automated) Variable names should be camel case. Variable names can contain number and special characters:
- (dropped) CSS files should be named the same as the component:
- (dropped) If a component requires multiple files (css, test) locate all files within component a folder
- (manual) Use .jsx or .tsx extension a for React components

## Bug Avoidance
- (automated) Use optional chaining if things can be null
- (automated) Use the guard pattern/prop types/typescript to ensure your passed in parameters are valid
- (manual) Create PURE functions and avoid side-effects
- (manual) Avoid mutating state when working with arrays
- (automated) Remove all console.log()
- (automated) Treat props as read-only. Do not try to modify them.

## Architecture & Clean Code
- (automated) No DRY violations. Create utility files to avoid duplicate code.
- (dropped) Follow the component/presentation pattern where appropriate. Components should follow the single responsibility principle
- (dropped) Use Higher Order Components where appropriate
- (manual) Split code into respective files, JavaScript, test, and CSS
- (dropped) Create a index.js within each folder for exporting. This will reduce repeating names on the imports
- (automated) Only include one React component per file
- (dropped) Favour functionless components
- (dropped) Do not use mixins
- (automated) No unneeded comments
- (automated) Methods that are longer than the screen should be refactored into smaller units
- (automated) Commented out code should be deleted, not committed

## ES6
- (automated) Can you use spread operator be used instead?
- (automated) Can you use destructuring be used instead?
- (automated) Only use let or const
- (automated) Favour arrow functions
- (automated) Can the optional chain operator be used instead of an explicit null check
- (automated) Can nullish coalescing by used instead of a explicit null comparison

## Testing
- Addressed in a separate segment

## CSS
- (automated) Avoid Inline CSS
- (dropped) A naming convention is defined and followed (BEM, SUIT, etc..)

<hr/>

## Misc
- (automated) Auto-fixed typescript aliases: the custom rule prefer-alias-imports automatically processes relative imports and converts them into alias imports
- (automated) Prefer arrow functions for React component definition: enforced by an eslint rule
- (automated) Import sorting: we sort imports into two categories: external (first) and internal (second).
- (automated) Prohibit default export: keeping exports composable.
- Loading, please wait...

## Other
- (manual) Minimum supported screen size in the SaintMaker is 360px width. As per this article https://worship.agency/mobile-screen-sizes-for-2022-based-on-data-from-2021 that will cover approximately 73% of 2021 mobile users (and I assume an even higher percentage of 2022 mobile users).
- (manual) We use the react-icons library within this app: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search
- (automated) We use folderslint to enforce a folder structure: https://github.com/denisraslov/folderslint
- (automated) We use husky to run unimported, eslint, folderslint, and prettier before you commit your code

<details><summary>Testing Standards</summary>
<p>

We use the running of yarn coverage to, for now, ensure that the utils folder is at a 100% code coverage (lines, functions, branches, and statements). This forces us to write tests and sets a quality benchmark for our testing

## Testing
- (kinda automated) Write tests
- (automated) Define a quality gate using coveralls
- (manual) Don't test more than one thing in a test
- (manual) No logic should exist within your test code
- (dropped) Test classes only test one class
- (manual) Code that needs to talk to a network, or, database is mocked
