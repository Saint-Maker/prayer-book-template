<p>

The draft of the SaintMaker PWA. Will eventually function as the town square for a multitude of other apps like a examination of conscience guide, a habit tracker, a lectio divina, etc.

<details><summary>Modders Guide</summary>
<p>

The SaintMaker has the goal of being "moddable" in that you can create additional applications independent of it and link them back to it. However, we curate said applications.

If you would like to create a mod for the SaintMaker then the steps for doing so are as follows:
- Fork the SaintMaker core repository and build your new application on top of it https://github.com/Saint-Maker/prayer-book-template-a
- To integrate your mod into our "marketplace" you'll need to create a branch off of the core repository; within it, run `yarn mod {your mod name} {your github user/organization name}`, this will generate a json file with a name like `Examen_cb0806151.json` in `src/mods` with a similar structure to the json included below. 
- Once you've filled out that json with your mods details, your pull request is ready to submit.
- We will then review your pull request and its corresponding codebase. If we believe it fits our audience (we probably will) we'll merge it; however, if it does not, users will still be able to add it as a custom mod.

```
{
    "id": "a unique identifier", // a unique identifier that will automatically be generated
    "name": "Name", // the name of your mod
    "issuesPageLink":  "https://github.../issues/new", // a link to the new issue page of your mods github/gitlab
    "path": 'https://something.com', // the url of your mod
    "description": "A description", // the description of your mod
    "isNative": false, // leave as false
}
```

<details><summary>Coding Standards</summary>
<p>

Krysztof: I pulled the bulk of the coding standards from this guide by [jondjones](https://www.jondjones.com/frontend/react/react-tutorials/react-coding-standards-and-practices-to-level-up-your-code/) (thank you Jon, I owe you a beer) and converted as many as I could to automated coding standards (eslint rules, prettier rules, etc). In addition to that, there is a bundle of other misc/manual coding standards that can be found at the end of this segment.

### Legend:
- (dropped): we aren't following this rule
- (manual): we are following this rule but couldn't find a way to automate it
- (automated): this rule is automatically being followed

## Naming Conventions
- (automated) Componentâ€™s names should be written using pascal case
- (automated) Non-components should be written using camel case
- (manual) Unit test files should use the same name as its corresponding file
- (automated) Attribute name should be camel case:
- (dropped) Inline styles should be camel case:
- (automated) Variable names should be camel case. Variable names can contain number and special characters:
- (dropped) CSS files should be named the same as the component:
- (dropped) If a component requires multiple files (css, test) locate all files within component a folder
- (manual) Use .jsx or .tsx extension a for React components

## Bug Avoidance
- (automated) Use optional chaining if things can be null
- (automated) Use the guard pattern/prop types/typescript to ensure your passed in parameters are valid
- (manual) Create PURE functions and avoid side-effects
- (manual) Avoid mutating state when working with arrays
- (automated) Remove all console.log()
- (automated) Treat props as read-only. Do not try to modify them.

## Architecture & Clean Code
- (automated) No DRY violations. Create utility files to avoid duplicate code.
- (dropped) Follow the component/presentation pattern where appropriate. Components should follow the single responsibility principle
- (dropped) Use Higher Order Components where appropriate
- (manual) Split code into respective files, JavaScript, test, and CSS
- (dropped) Create a index.js within each folder for exporting. This will reduce repeating names on the imports
- (automated) Only include one React component per file
- (dropped) Favour functionless components
- (dropped) Do not use mixins
- (automated) No unneeded comments
- (automated) Methods that are longer than the screen should be refactored into smaller units
- (automated) Commented out code should be deleted, not committed

## ES6
- (automated) Can you use spread operator be used instead?
- (automated) Can you use destructuring be used instead?
- (automated) Only use let or const
- (automated) Favour arrow functions
- (automated) Can the optional chain operator be used instead of an explicit null check
- (automated) Can nullish coalescing by used instead of a explicit null comparison

## Testing
- Addressed in a separate segment

## CSS
- (automated) Avoid Inline CSS
- (dropped) A naming convention is defined and followed (BEM, SUIT, etc..)

<hr/>

## Misc
- (automated) Auto-fixed typescript aliases: the custom rule prefer-alias-imports automatically processes relative imports and converts them into alias imports
- (automated) Prefer arrow functions for React component definition: enforced by an eslint rule
- (automated) Import sorting: we sort imports into two categories: external (first) and internal (second).
- (automated) Prohibit default export: keeping exports composable.
- Loading, please wait...

## Other
- (manual) Minimum supported screen size in the SaintMaker is 360px width. As per this article https://worship.agency/mobile-screen-sizes-for-2022-based-on-data-from-2021 that will cover approximately 73% of 2021 mobile users (and I assume an even higher percentage of 2022 mobile users).
- (manual) We use the react-icons library within this app: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search
- (automated) We use folderslint to enforce a folder structure: https://github.com/denisraslov/folderslint
- (automated) We use husky to run unimported, eslint, folderslint, and prettier before you commit your code

<details><summary>Testing Standards</summary>
<p>

We use the running of yarn coverage to, for now, ensure that the utils folder is at a 100% code coverage (lines, functions, branches, and statements). This forces us to write tests and sets a quality benchmark for our testing

## Testing
- (kinda automated) Write tests
- (automated) Define a quality gate using coveralls
- (manual) Don't test more than one thing in a test
- (manual) No logic should exist within your test code
- (dropped) Test classes only test one class
- (manual) Code that needs to talk to a network, or, database is mocked
